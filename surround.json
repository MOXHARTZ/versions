        "updateTime handler has been updated. It will now be triggered when the time of the song is updated not by interval",
        "Songs will now play 2 to 3 seconds faster than before. (Songs longer than 15 minutes are no longer checked when playing a song. But when searching or pulling information from a url, songs longer than 15 minutes will not be listed. So it's now your responsibility to play songs longer than 15 minutes)",
        "Errors from api can now be handled. In other words, when an error occurs, that error can be handled. (so there will be no unnecessary waiting time when an error occurs)",
        "It was observed that people with slow internet speed could not play the songs. Therefore the 20 seconds requirement has been changed to 90 seconds. If a song does not play within 90 seconds, it will be deleted",
        "Fixed sometimes audioplayer's loader showing forever",
        "Search is now 2 times faster",
        "Fixed a very rare bug in the API where the song would not play",
        "In audioplayer fixed currentTime being confused when you play more than one song",
        "Fixed the issue where if you try to play the same id song again very quickly, the song is played twice without destroying it",
        "Fixed the problem that when a song is attached to a entity the song is not attached due to infinity",
        "The currentTime update from yesterday has been reverted because it caused a ui lag issue",
        "Fixed local audio files playing slower than before",
        "Fixed a bug when you play a song and then destroy before it loads",
        "`xsound:streamerMode` event added. Its same as xsound",
        "Some minor optimizations on the ui",
        "New export `getAllAudioInfo` added. It returns all the information of the audio"
